# trialblaze
A chatbot built with botbuilder-adapter-trovo for Trovo.live

## Install

You need node.js and npmjs installed.

### For Developers:
`git clone https://github.com/unarmedguitar/trialblaze`

### For Testers:
`Click on the Code button and at the bottom of the dialog is Download ZIP`
This will download trialblaze-main.zip
`Extract the folder`
Once extracted you need to open up an admin powershell or terminal and navigate inside
the directory. e.g. if you extracted it on your Desktop,
inside admin powershell:
`cd "$HOME/Desktop/trialblaze-main"`

## Next Step

`npm install`

Edit your .env file and fill in your bot details. This file is maybe hidden so you should
show hidden files to see it.

`npm start`

Enjoy
