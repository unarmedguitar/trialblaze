# trialblaze
A chatbot built with botbuilder-adapter-trovo for Trovo.live

## Install

You need node.js and npmjs installed.

### For Developers:
`git clone https://github.com/unarmedguitar/trialblaze`

### For Testers:
`Click on the Code button then at the bottom of the dialog is Download ZIP`
This will download trialblaze-main.zip
`Extract the folder`
Once extracted you need to open up an admin powershell or terminal and navigate inside
the directory. e.g. if you extracted it on your Desktop,
inside admin powershell:
`cd "$HOME/Desktop/trialblaze-main"`

## Next Step

`npm install`

*There will be warnings for deprecated packages used by botkit/botuilder which can be ignored.* 

You should create a new Trovo account to use as your bot.
Then edit the .env file and fill it with your bot credentials. This file could be hidden so
you should show hidden files.

`npm start`

Enjoy
